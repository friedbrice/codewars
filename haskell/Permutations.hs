module Codewars.Kata.Permutations (permutations) where

-- In this kata you have to create all permutations of an input string
-- and remove duplicates, if present. This means, you have to shuffle
-- all letters from the input in all possible orders.

-- Examples:

-- permutations    "a" `shouldBe` ["a"]
-- permutations   "ab" `shouldBe` ["ab", "ba"]
-- permutations "aabb" `shouldBe` ["aabb","abab","abba","baab","baba","bbaa"]
-- The order of the permutations doesn't matter.
